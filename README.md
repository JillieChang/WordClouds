<p style="text-align:justify"> A Word Cloud  or Tag Cloud is a graphical representation of word frequency within a text: the more often a word is used in a text, the bigger and bolder it is represented in a graph. It can be a useful tool to communicate at a glance the most important keywords in a particular text or topic in a effective and fun way. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify"> In this tutorial we will create a Word Cloud from a sample of nameless tweets extracted from Twitter for the period 3/16/2020 - 08/31/2020 in Peru. The dataset was modificated to respect Twitter private information policy and is used just as an example to show how to create a Word Cloud. With this dataset, we will do different examples of Word Clouds by using the following steps: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Install packages and import libraries </li>
  <li>Import the dataset, clean it up and select the text you are going to work with (tweets)</li>
  <li>Perform the text preprocessing and create a clean variable </li>
  <li>Create your Word Cloud:
    <p>  </p>  
      <ul> 
          <li> Example 1: Default model</li>
          <li> Example 2: Default model - customize parameters </li>
          <li> Example 3: Customize shapes </li>
          <li> Example 4: Customize colors - set multiple colors with a mask </li>
          <li> Example 5: Customize colors - set a single color with a mask </li>
          <li> Example 6: Customize colors - set multiple colors with a function</li>
          <li> Example 7: Customize content - set repeated words</li>
          <li> Example 8: Customize content - set non-repeated words </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <p>  </p>  
    
   <li>Finally, you can review Bibliography to look for more information</li>   
</ol>
